## Introduction
Cargo Exo uses the power of GPT from OpenAI to process the warnings and errors from your Rust code, generating intelligent, context-aware suggestions to fix them. With interactive confirmation prompts, you have complete control over which changes to apply.

## Installation

To install Cargo Exo, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Rust, please follow the instructions on the official [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

With Rust and cargo installed, you can install the Cargo Exo plugin using the following command:

```bash
$ cargo install --git http://github.com/danrspencer/cargo_exo
```

## Usage

You can use Cargo Exo alongside standard cargo commands like so:

```bash
$ cargo exo clippy -- -D warnings
```

This command runs `cargo clippy` with the `-D warnings` flag, then processes any warnings or errors using Cargo Exo. If there are any fixable issues, Cargo Exo will present the suggested changes in a diff format, and ask if you'd like to apply the changes.

Example output:

```bash
ðŸ¤– cargo exo clippy -- -D warnings
error: unused variable: `t`
 --> cargo-exo-functions/src/explain/mod.rs:7:13
  |
7 |         let t = "test";
  |             ^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_t`
  |
  = note: `-D unused-variables` implied by `-D warnings`

âœ” Phone a friend? ðŸ“žðŸ¤– Â· yes
â ™ ðŸ¤– thinking ... (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613)
  ðŸ¤– done!

error: unused variable
 --> cargo-exo-functions/src/explain/mod.rs:7
7 | -        let t = "test";
7 | +        let _t = "test";
âœ” Do you want to apply these changes? Â· yes
```

As shown, Cargo Exo takes the unused variable warning, suggests a fix and asks for your confirmation to apply the changes.
